                        My name is Mikayla and I'm someone with a wide variety of interests. 

                        <br><br>

                        I'm currently pursuing my bachelors in Information Technology through Kennesaw State University but I hope to continue through tha tinto my masters in Cybersecurity. My interest in technology is why some of my hobbies inclued video games and coding such as with LED lights and learning more about what I can make them do. On top of my tech side I have a deep passion for art and my mediums that I work with include; traditional pencil and paper, digital design, woodburning (pyrography), resin and some leatherwork.
